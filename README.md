## Introduction
**Background Information**

Basketball is primarily a 5 on 5 team based game. Each team will have a Point Guard (PG),
Shooting guard (SG), Small Forward (SF), Power Forward (PF), and a Center (C). The main
way of scoring points are a field goals, which consist of 2 pointers and 3 pointers. As
well as free throws, which consist of 1 point. the main defensive statistics are Blocks,
Steals, and Defensive Rebounds. 

A Point Guards (PG) main roll is to be the general of the team, also known as the play-maker.
PG's tend to be the smallest player on the court with high basketball IQ. they tend to have
good ball handling skills and are usually fast, Resulting in high number of assist and 2 point
field goals. 

A Shooting Guard (SG) are shooting specialist, mainly focusing on perimeter shooting. excelling
in mid-range shots and 3-point field goals. 

A Small Forward (SF) are the jack of all trades, as they as they can score anywhere on the court.
They are usually quick and strong, with the ability to drive into the paint and score points, 
and are able to draw fouls for a potential "and 1" play.

A Power Forward (PF) are considered good scoring option when they are close to the rim, as
they tend to be the most explosive player on the court. PF's tend to have a good Post game,
drawing in multiple opposition player, to create open shots for their teammates. They should
also have good defensive abilities as they play close to the rim. 

A Center (C) have similar traits to a PF, however, a key difference is that they tend
to be the tallest and strongest players of the court. 

**Scenario**

As the Chicago Bull finished at an overall ranking of 27 out of 30 teams in the 2018-19
NBA season with a Record of 22 wins and 60 Losses. Due to the teams poor performance,
they have been allocated a budget of $118 million for player contacts. This is low compared
to the Portland trailblazers who have the largest budget of $140 million. While the team with
the best record in league in the 2018-19 season were allocated $131 million.

**Aim of the Project**

With an allocated budget of $118 Million, we are tasked to find the best potential
starting 5 for the 2019-20 NBA season. However, the $118 Million budget is for
recruitment of a full squad and needs to be considered when recruiting players.

**Justification and Importance**

We want to recruit players in-order to deliver and win an NBA Championship for
the City of Chicago. Analyzing players based on their salaries and the statistics
will aid us in determining and identifying hidden gems and clear must haves for the team.
